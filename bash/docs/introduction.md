I'll just begin with a simple text line.

I would then like to add an inline chunk of code, like "to import the numeric python library, you just type `import numpy` and you're all good.

Next, how about I try a longer code block?

```
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(0,10)
if 2 in x:
    print("2 trovato!")
```
