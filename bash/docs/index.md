# Welcome to a quick bash programming guide

This serves both as a startup project to get familiar with mkdocs and to create a quick bash guide containing the commands I'll encounter in my new job. The document will be "from me to myself", i.e. I will ofter write and explain things in way that I can easily understand when reading them. If you're reading this and you're not me, I hope they're still somehow helpful.
