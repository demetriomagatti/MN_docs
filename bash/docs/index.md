# Welcome to a quick bash programming guide

This serves both as a startup project to get familiar with mkdocs and to create a quick bash guide containing the commands I'll encounter in my new job. The document will be "from me to myself", i.e. I will ofter write and explain things in way that I can easily understand them when reading. If you're reading this and you're not me, I hope they're still somehow helpful. The main source for this handbook is actually [this one](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners), with some personal notes and comments added here and there.
