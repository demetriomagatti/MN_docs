# Welcome to a quick bash programming guide

This serves both as a startup project to get familiar with mkdocs and to create a quick bash guide containing the commands I'll encounter in my new job. The document will be "from me to myself", i.e. I will ofter write and explain things in way that I can easily understand them when reading. If you're reading this and you're not me, I hope they're still somehow helpful. The main source for this handbook is actually [this one](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners), with some personal notes and comments added here and there.

## Project layout

Basically, I'll just go over some examples and explain how bash is interpreting and doing things. Here you have some tips that I hope can allow a better comprehension of the guide. 

In-text variables, filenames, commands will be formatted as `command example`.

Many-line codes chunk will be put together in a gray box, as following:

```bash
first code line
second code line
```

Every now and then, we'll be interest in some command's output. They will still be enveloped in a box, but will also have an extra indentation block and will be red-colored:
```bash
this is a command
```
> `and this is its output`
